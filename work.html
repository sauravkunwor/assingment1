    <p>My name is saurav kunwor. I am computer engineering student. I love watching and playing Basketball.</p>
    <p>As a computer engineering student with a passion for basketball, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and
        sports by undertaking innovative projects that leverage cutting-edge techniques to enhance the game's experience
        and performance.</p>
    <p> Engineers play a crucial role in designing and developing sports equipment such as basketballs, basketball
        shoes, and other gear. They optimize materials, aerodynamics, and performance to enhance players' abilities and
        safety.</p>
